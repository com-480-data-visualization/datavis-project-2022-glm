    "This project will be based on worldwide energy data that can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption). Also, it will be completed by a [second dataset](https://github.com/albertyw/avenews/blob/master/old/data/average-latitude-longitude-countries.csv) that contains the longitude and latitude of every country as this may be useful for creating map visualizations. We will therefore work with a time series dataset, that contains information about energy generation and consumption from 1900 to 2020 for every country. Additional data compirses the `population`, `gdp` .\n",
