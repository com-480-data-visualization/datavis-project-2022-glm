                        Over the last few centuries, the availability of energy has had a big impact on humanity.
                        New energy sources have been discorvered, such as fossil fuels, nuclear and hydropower, but the
                        quantity we produce and consume has also eveolved. Energy demands are growing which poses a threat
                        to renewable energy sources since they are not exploited to the same extent as fossil fuels. 
    
                        How has the quantity of clean vs non-renewable energy consumed evolved over the last century?<br>

                            Gas, coal and oil are all non-renewable energy sources. They exist on Earth in a finite amount and cannot be replaced 
                            naturally at a pace quick enough to keep up with consumption. Eventually, these fossil-based resources will become 
                            too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy.<br>
                            <br>
                            Three main replacements are solar, wind and hydro. These are called renewable energy sources because they are naturally replenished on a human timescale. 
                            Renewable energy often provides energy for electricity generation to a grid, air and water heating/cooling, and stand-alone power systems.<br>

                            Since 1965, global energy consumption has been on the rise, growing from approximately
                            40 thousand TWh to 140 thousand TWh. Indeed, as populations increase and people get richer, 
                            the demand for energy across many countries in the world has grown significantly. <br>

                            Globally, it seems that all six sources of energy have evolved similarly, with solar and wind 
                            appearing in the early 2000's. <br>
                            By looking at how the energy consumption from the different sources has evolved in terms of 
                            <button class="btn", id="expanded">proportions</button> it becomes even more evident that 
                            that the situation has been stable for a very long time, with gas experiencing a slight increase and

                            In Europe, energy consumption as a whole increased during the 
                            industrial growth following WWII, from the early sixties up until the early nineties.
                            In contrast to the global picture, energy consumption has been stable in Europe
                            from the nineties and onward. <br>

                            We can again look at the evolution of energy consumption in terms of 
                            <button class="btn", id="expanded-eu">proportions</button>. Here we can see that, while gas 
                            is increasing as in the global picture, coal has been experienciing a decrease since the 
                            early nineties. Additionally, renewable energy sources, especially wind and hydro, have been 
                            taking up a larger share in Europe than globally in recent years, with apprximately 15%.
                            This is likely due to the larger proportion of developed countries in the continent and the pressure
                            that inhabitants put on their government to bet more on renewable sources of energy.<br>

                            Switzerland, a developed country in the heart of Europe has experienced a stable energy consumption
                            since 1965. Additionally they rely heavily on hydro and very little on gas and coal which is in strong contrast to
                            the both Europe and the global picture. <br>

                            Norway, another developed country in Europe has experienced strong increase in energy consumption
                            throughout the whole period. Similarly to Switzerland, Norway focuses heavily on hydro energy as we can see
                            by studying the <button class="btn", id="expanded-no">proportions</button>.  The trend is again similar
                            to Switzerland, with coal being used in smaller and smaller proportions and gas experiencing a slight oncrease over time.

                        The animated map on the previous slide shows the evolution of the renewable energy consumption over the years.
                        It can be noted that the intensity of the color is getting higher which indicates overall growth in renewables consumption.
                        When approaching the 2000's, we see that China, the United States and Brazil are the "greenest", however, keep in
                        mind that these countries also have a high population that consumes more energy.

                        When analysing countries individually, the respective charts show a clear growth over time, so more renewable energy is produced and consumed
                        generally speaking. There are nontheless some countries like Algeria, Switzerland, etc. that present different behaviors.
                        Algeria, for example, hits its lowest level in the years 2000-2002. This may be related to the Algerian Civil War which ended in 2002 as the
                        the country's focus was channeled elswhere. Switzerland, on the other hand, displays a rather uniform behavior over the years. This might be
                        an indicatior of the country's contstant concern about climate change and getting clean energy.
